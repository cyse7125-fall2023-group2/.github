The project focuses on using Kubernetes to coordinate distributed systems, leveraging a collection of versatile and reusable software design strategies. These strategies encompass patterns such as the Sidecar pattern, Ambassador pattern, Adapter pattern, Event-Driven architecture, Stream and Batch Processing, Containers and Container Orchestration, Replication, Partitioning, Transactions, Consistency, and Consensus. This approach aims to improve the ease and effectiveness of creating dependable distributed systems.

The goal of the project is to develop expertise in creating applications for hybrid cloud environments and seamlessly integrating existing monolithic applications with microservices without necessitating a full-scale rewrite.
